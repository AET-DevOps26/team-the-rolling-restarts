# Observability

OpenTelemetry + Grafana's all-in-one `otel-lgtm` image (real Prometheus + Grafana + Tempo +
Loki + Pyroscope, one container) — not a standalone Prometheus deployment, but the image
genuinely bundles Prometheus (verified by pulling `grafana/otel-lgtm` and inspecting
`/otel-lgtm/prometheus/prometheus`), satisfying "Prometheus must be used"
(`docs/requirements/07-observability.md`) literally, not just in spirit.

## What's wired up

- All 3 Spring services push metrics + traces via OTLP to `grafana-lgtm:4318`
  (`management.otlp.metrics.export.url`, `management.opentelemetry.tracing.export.otlp.endpoint`)
  — the bundled OTel Collector forwards these straight into the bundled Prometheus.
- All 3 Spring services also expose `/actuator/prometheus` (classic scrape), and gen-ai exposes
  `/metrics` — scraped directly by the bundled Prometheus (`infra/grafana/prometheus.yaml`) purely
  to give a real `up{job=...}` signal, since OTLP-pushed metrics don't populate it.
- `services/gen-ai` exports OpenTelemetry traces and custom LLM metrics via OTLP (unchanged from
  before this work).
- Dashboard: `infra/grafana/dashboards/service-overview.json` (adapted from the image's own
  bundled RED-metrics dashboard), provisioned automatically in both docker-compose and
  Kubernetes/Helm.
- Alerts: `infra/grafana/provisioning/alerting/rules.yaml` — slow response time (p95 > 1s) and
  service down (`up == 0`).
- Log export is wired up and was verified end-to-end (not just configured): all 4 services
  forward application logs to Loki via OTLP. The 3 Spring services needed three new pieces —
  the `opentelemetry-logback-appender-1.0` dependency, a `logback-spring.xml`, and a small
  `OtelLogbackAppenderInstaller` `@Component` that calls `OpenTelemetryAppender.install(...)`
  against the **Spring-managed `OpenTelemetry` bean**. This last point was a real bug found
  during verification: installing against `GlobalOpenTelemetry.get()` instead returns a no-op
  instance and silently drops every log record (Spring Boot's `OtlpLoggingAutoConfiguration`
  builds the exporter but never registers it as the global instance). gen-ai attaches its OTel
  `LoggingHandler` (`services/gen-ai/app/observability.py`) to the root logger **and** explicitly
  to `uvicorn` / `uvicorn.error` / `uvicorn.access`, because uvicorn's default logging config
  disables propagation to root on those loggers — a root-only handler would miss virtually all
  request traffic.
- `RequestLoggingFilter` added to all 3 Spring services (`config/RequestLoggingFilter.java`),
  logging `"{method} {requestURI}"` at INFO for every request. Spring Boot emits no per-request
  access-log line by default, so this exists purely to give `infra/scripts/smoke-test.sh`'s Loki
  cross-check something to grep for.
- `infra/scripts/smoke-test.sh` cross-checks its own requests against Loki after running,
  skipping gracefully wherever Grafana isn't reachable (VM/k8s without a tunnel/port-forward).
  Verified against a real running docker-compose stack: 35/35 checks passing, including the
  Loki cross-check.
- Deployed to Kubernetes/Helm as well as docker-compose (`infra/helm/templates/monitoring.yaml`,
  `infra/k8s/deployments/grafana-lgtm-deployment.yml`).
- Security fix applied: `/actuator/prometheus` is permitted (unauthenticated) in each service's
  SecurityConfig so Prometheus can scrape it internally, but that initially also made it
  reachable unauthenticated from the public internet, because `/actuator/**` was publicly routed
  through `infra/nginx/default.conf` (docker-compose/Azure VM) and both `infra/k8s/ingress.yml`
  and `infra/helm/templates/ingress.yaml` (Kubernetes). Fixed by narrowing all 3 public routes to
  `/actuator/health` only — internal Prometheus scraping is unaffected since it hits each service
  directly over the internal network, never through those proxies.

## Known gaps

- No per-pod resource-usage (CPU/memory) panel in Kubernetes — the cAdvisor/kubelet-scrape
  approach needs cluster-scoped RBAC (`nodes/metrics`, `nodes/proxy`) that this course cluster
  doesn't grant to namespaced tenants (verified: `kubectl auth can-i create clusterrole` → `no`,
  checked against the real cluster, not assumed).
- The Kubernetes resource budget for `grafana-lgtm` is tight (see `infra/helm/values.yaml`'s
  `monitoring.resources` and the trimmed limits on every other service) — every other service's
  Helm `values.yaml` and raw `infra/k8s/deployments/*.yml` limits were trimmed to make room for
  it inside the namespace's hard quota (2 CPU / 3000Mi at 2 replicas/service, verified empirically
  against the live cluster). Margin is small (~210m CPU / ~60Mi memory across the whole
  namespace) — verify with `kubectl top pod` after deploying and adjust if it's running close to
  the limit.
- `infra/helm/files/grafana/*` is a manually-copied duplicate of `infra/grafana/*` — Helm's
  `.Files.Get` can't escape the chart root (`infra/helm/`), so the 4 config files had to be
  copied in rather than referenced directly. Nothing in CI enforces the two stay in sync; if
  `infra/grafana/*` changes, remember to re-copy into `infra/helm/files/grafana/`.
